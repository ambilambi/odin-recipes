Odin Project's first beginner friendly HTML project. The learning objective included formatting paragraphs, adding links and images, and using ordered and unordered lists.  Quickly realized could copy/paste HTML format so project did not take long.  However connecting VSC files to Github was problematic and had to fix link pathways to get to load properly. Through this I learned how to create the proper pathways in Github.
